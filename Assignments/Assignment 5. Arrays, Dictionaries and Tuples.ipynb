    "One way to measure these kinds of relationships is Markov analysis, which characterizes, for a given sequence of words, the probability of the words that might come next. For example, the song Eric, the Half a Bee begins:\n",

    "For example, if you start with the prefix “Half a”, then the next word has to be “bee”, because the prefix only appears once in the text. The next prefix is “a bee”, so the next suffix might be “philosophically”, “be” or “due”.\n",

    "In this example the length of the prefix is always two, but you can do Markov analysis with any prefix length.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write a program to read a text from a file and perform Markov analysis. The result should be a dictionary that maps from prefixes to a collection of possible suffixes. The collection might be a list, tuple, or dictionary; it is up to you to make an appropriate choice. You can test your program with prefix length two, but you should write the program in a way that makes it easy to try other lengths.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Add a function to the previous program to generate random text based on the Markov analysis. Here is an example from Emma with prefix length 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "       He was very clever, be it sweetness or be angry, ashamed or only amused, at such a stroke. She had never thought of Hannah till you were never meant for me?\" \"I cannot make speeches, Emma:\" he soon cut it all himself.\n",

    "    For this example, I left the punctuation attached to the words. The result is almost syntactically correct, but not quite. Semantically, it almost makes sense, but not quite.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    What happens if you increase the prefix length? Does the random text make more sense?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Once your program is working, you might want to try a mash-up: if you combine text from two or more books, the random text you generate will blend the vocabulary and phrases from the sources in interesting ways.\n",
