This chapter is about iteration, which is the ability to run a block of statements repeatedly. We saw a kind of iteration, using recursion, in “Recursion”. We saw another kind, using a `for` loop, in “Simple Repetition”. In this chapter we’ll see yet another kind, using a `while` statement.

md"""At this point I want to address a common source of confusion. Because Julia uses the equals sign (`=`) for assignment, it is tempting to interpret a statement like `a = b` as a mathematical proposition of equality; that is, the claim that `a` and `b` are equal. But this interpretation is wrong.

First, equality is a symmetric relationship and assignment is not. For example, in mathematics, if ``a = 7`` then ``7 = a``. But in Julia, the statement `a = 7` is legal and `7 = a` is not.

Also, in mathematics, a proposition of equality is either true or false for all time. If ``a = b`` now, then ``a`` will always equal ``b``. In Julia, an assignment statement can make two variables equal, but they don’t have to stay that way:

!!! danger
    Reassigning variables is often useful, but you should use it with caution. If the values of variables change frequently, it can make the code difficult to read and debug.

    It is illegal to define a function that has the same name as a previously defined variable.

md"""## The `while` Statement

Computers are often used to automate repetitive tasks. Repeating identical or similar tasks without making errors is something that computers do well and people do poorly. In a computer program, repetition is also called *iteration*.

We have already seen two functions, `countdown` and `printn`, that iterate using recursion. Because iteration is so common, Julia provides language features to make it easier. One is the `for` statement we saw in “Simple Repetition”. We’ll get back to that later.

Another is the *`while` statement*. Here is a version of `countdown` that uses a `while` statement:
"""

# ╔═╡ afded099-5415-46bb-abd5-6357835f3e83
function countdown(n)
	while n > 0
		print(n, " ")
		n -= 1
	end
	println("Blastoff!")
end

# ╔═╡ 8fe33b17-8288-4a51-8cc4-680eb5960b9a
md"""You can almost read the `while` statement as if it were English. It means, “While `n` is greater than `0`, display the value of `n` and then decrement `n`. When you get to `0`, display the word `"Blastoff!"`”

More formally, here is the flow of execution for a `while` statement:


1. Determine whether the condition is true or false.
2. If false, exit the `while` statement and continue execution at the next statement.
3. If the condition is true, run the body and then go back to step 1.


This type of flow is called a loop because the third step loops back around to the top.

The body of the loop should change the value of one or more variables so that the condition becomes false eventually and the loop terminates. Otherwise, the loop will repeat forever, which is called an *infinite loop*. An endless source of amusement for computer scientists is the observation that the directions on shampoo bottles, “Lather, rinse, repeat,” are an infinite loop.

In the case of `countdown`, we can prove that the loop terminates: if `n` is `0` or negative, the loop never runs. Otherwise, `n` gets smaller each time through the loop, so eventually we have to get to `0`.

For some other loops, it is not so easy to tell. For example:
"""

# ╔═╡ b45aaed5-4436-491d-825f-7df9d98458f9
function seq(n)
	while n != 1
		println(n)
		if n % 2 == 0   # n is even
			n /= 2
		else
			n = 3n + 1  # n is odd
		end
	end
end

# ╔═╡ b54af953-a3a2-4f7c-b798-114773f5f2bb
md"""The condition for this loop is `n != 1`, so the loop will continue until `n` is `1`, which makes the condition false.

Each time through the loop, the program outputs the value of `n` and then checks whether it is even or odd. If it is even, `n` is divided by 2. If it is odd, the value ofnis replaced with `3n + 1`. For example, if the argument passed to `seq` is `3`, the resulting values of `n` are `3`, `10`, `5.0`, `16.0`, `8.0`, `4.0`, `2.0`, `1.0`.

Since `n` sometimes increases and sometimes decreases, there is no obvious proof that `n` will ever reach `1`, or that the program terminates. For some particular values of `n`, we can prove termination. For example, if the starting value is a power of two, `n` will be even every time through the loop until it reaches `1`. The previous example ends with such a sequence, starting with `16`.

The hard question is whether we can prove that this program terminates for all positive values of `n`. So far, no one has been able to prove it or disprove it!

            n = n - 1

            n -= 1;

    The C syntax is similar:

    void countdown(int n) {
        while (n > 0) {
            printf("%i ", n);
            n -= 1;
        }

    }
    ```

# ╔═╡ 5adbadaa-76a6-11eb-34b0-0b02b1cd9f95
md"""## `break`

Sometimes you don’t know it’s time to end a loop until you get halfway through the body. In that case you can use the *`break` statement* to jump out of the loop.

For example, suppose you want to take input from the user until they type **`done`**. You could write:

```julia
while true
    print("> ")
    line = readline()
    if line == "done"
		break
	end
	println(line)
end
println("Done!")
```

The loop condition is `true`, which is always true, so the loop runs until it hits the
`break` statement.

Each time through, it prompts the user with an angle bracket. If the user types **`done`**, the `break` statement exits the loop. Otherwise, the program echoes whatever the user types and goes back to the top of the loop. Here’s a sample run:

```
> not done
not done
> done
Done!
```

This way of writing `while` loops is common because you can check the condition anywhere in the loop (not just at the top) and you can express the stop condition affirmatively (“stop when this happens”) rather than negatively (“keep going until that happens”).

Rather than checking whether `x` and `y` are exactly equal, it is safer to use the built-in function `abs` to compute the absolute value, or magnitude, of the difference between them:

md"""## Algorithms

Newton’s method is an example of an *algorithm*: it is a mechanical process for solving a category of problems (in this case, computing square roots).

To understand what an algorithm is, it might help to start with something that is not an algorithm. When you learned to multiply single-digit numbers, you probably memorized the multiplication table. In effect, you memorized 100 specific solutions. That kind of knowledge is not algorithmic.

But if you were “lazy”, you might have learned a few tricks. For example, to find the product of ``n`` and ``9``, you can write ``n−1`` as the first digit and ``10−n`` as the second digit. This trick is a general solution for multiplying any single-digit number by ``9``. That’s an algorithm!

Similarly, the techniques you learned for addition with carrying, subtraction with borrowing, and long division are all algorithms. One of the characteristics of algo‐ rithms is that they do not require any intelligence to carry out. They are mechanical processes where each step follows from the last according to a simple set of rules.

Executing algorithms is boring, but designing them is interesting, intellectually challenging, and a central part of computer science.

Some of the things that people do naturally, without difficulty or conscious thought, are the hardest to express algorithmically. Understanding natural language is a good example. We all do it, but so far no one has been able to explain how we do it, at least not in the form of an algorithm.

md"""## Debugging
As you start writing bigger programs, you might find yourself spending more time debugging. More code means more chances to make an error and more places for bugs to hide.

One way to cut your debugging time is “debugging by bisection.” For example, if there are 100 lines in your program and you check them one at a time, it will take 100 steps.

Instead, try to break the problem in half. Look at the middle of the program, or near it, for an intermediate value you can check. Add a print statement (or something else that has a verifiable effect) and run the program.

If the midpoint check is incorrect, there must be a problem in the first half of the pro‐ gram. If it is correct, the problem is in the second half.

Every time you perform a check like this, you halve the number of lines you have to search. In theory, after six steps (which is significantly fewer than 100), you’ll be down to one or two lines of code.

In practice, it is not always clear what the “middle of the program” is and not always possible to check it. It doesn’t make sense to count lines and find the exact midpoint. Instead, think about places in the program where there might be errors and places where it is easy to put a check. Then choose a spot where you think the chances are about the same that the bug is before or after the check.
