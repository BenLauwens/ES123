md"""## Persistence

Most of the programs we have seen so far are transient, in the sense that they run for a short time and produce some output, but when they end, their data disappears. If you run the program again, it starts with a clean slate.

Other programs are *persistent*: they run for a long time (or all the time); they keep at least some of their data in permanent storage (a hard drive, for example); and if they shut down and restart, they pick up where they left off.

Examples of persistent programs are operating systems, which run pretty much whenever a computer is on, and web servers, which run all the time, waiting for requests to come in on the network.

One of the simplest ways for programs to maintain their data is by reading and writing text files. We have already seen programs that read text files; in this chapter we will see programs that write them.

An alternative is to store the state of the program in a database. In this chapter I will also present how to use a simple database.

md"""## Reading and Writing

A *text file* is a sequence of characters stored on a permanent medium like a hard drive or flash memory. We saw how to open and read a file in “Reading Word Lists”.

To write a file, you have to open it with mode `"w"` as a second parameter:
"""

md"""If the file already exists, opening it in write mode clears out the old data and starts fresh, so be careful! If the file doesn’t exist a new one is created. In this case the file **`output.txt`** is created in a temporary directory. The function `joinpath` takes a directory and a filename and joins them into a complete path. `open` returns a file object and the `write` function puts data into the file:
"""

# ╔═╡ ce9cb280-fe46-4cdd-8125-b79ba5e6dc1c
let
	line1 = "This here's the wattle,\n"

The argument of `write` has to be a string, so if we want to put other values in a file, we have to convert them to strings. The easiest way to do that is with `string` or string interpolation:

md"""## Filenames and Paths

Files are organized into *directories* (also called “folders”). Every running program has a “current directory,” which is the default directory for most operations. For example, when you open a file for reading, Julia looks for it in the current directory.

The function `pwd` returns the name of the current directory:
"""

# ╔═╡ 28415fde-b4fd-4deb-81f6-e65d2fc4a544
cwd = pwd()

# ╔═╡ 0c5d51e8-1086-4207-be42-2dc06c3dd0de
Markdown.parse("""`cwd` stands for “current working directory.” The results is *$cwd*. A string like `"$cwd"` that identifies a file or directory is called a *path*.

A simple filename like *$this_file* is also considered a path, but it is a *relative path* because it relates to the current directory. If the current directory is *$cwd*, the filename *$this_file* would refer to *$cwd/$this_file*.

A path that begins with */* does not depend on the current directory; it is called an *absolute path*. To find the absolute path to a file, you can use `abspath`:
""")

# ╔═╡ 0edcafc4-bbeb-47be-bd68-fe27835c1103
let
	filename = split(basename(@__FILE__), '#')[1]
	println(filename)
	abspath(filename)
end

# ╔═╡ c30385f8-239b-4d58-8e80-3111b0eedca3
md"""The macro `@__FILE__` returns the absolute path of the current file. The function `basename` extracts the filename. In the notebook interface an identifier starting with `#` is added, which we can eliminate by splitting and taking the first part.

Julia provides other functions for working with filenames and paths. For example, `ispath` checks whether a file or directory exists:
"""

# ╔═╡ 6dddaad9-a5a3-456d-a7b0-699e633cb121
ispath(filename)

# ╔═╡ eeecb94e-01b7-42a4-89ca-cd8127073dd7

	dir = @__DIR__
	println(dir)
	ispath(dir)
end

# ╔═╡ c541beed-5d2d-4b30-ae91-ea00ab59ef47
md"""The macro `@__DIR__` returns the directory of the current file. Similarly, `isfile` checks whether it’s a file.

`readdir` returns an array of the files (and other directories) in the given directory:
"""

# ╔═╡ 3d222470-485a-4c12-8c6e-8c39ddeb1da7
readdir(dir)

# ╔═╡ 7866e766-4e1b-4775-9fc0-e5cb56062e3f

function walk(dirname)
	for name in readdir(dirname)

"""

# ╔═╡ 9ebf14b8-8a7b-11eb-3347-dbc6f1972fb2
md"""## Catching Exceptions

A lot of things can go wrong when you try to read and write files. If you try to open a file that doesn’t exist, you get a `SystemError`:
"""

# ╔═╡ 62ecd089-17cd-43f4-9f18-9d4ecb3055d1
open("bad_file")

# ╔═╡ d9354b74-76c6-43ac-9bf1-cf5da48c3f2c

"""

open("/etc/passwd", "w")

# ╔═╡ 4ad55cd4-1d46-49e0-a205-e53368d79791
md"""To avoid these errors you could use functions like `ispath` and `isfile`, but it would take a lot of time and code to check all the possibilities.

It’s easier to go ahead and try, and deal with problems if they happen—which is exactly what the `try` statement does. The syntax is similar to an `if` statement:
"""

# ╔═╡ 9b9fba28-69f4-49c3-bf8b-040683b88872
try
	fin = open("bad_file.txt")
catch exc
	println("Something went wrong: $exc")
end

# ╔═╡ 53966b4e-accd-4f76-9edd-70a1570f6c5f
md"""Julia starts by executing the `try` clause. If all goes well, it skips the `catch` clause and proceeds. If an exception occurs, it jumps out of the `try` clause and runs the `catch` clause.

Handling an exception with a `try` statement is called *catching* an exception. In this example, the except clause prints an error message that is not very helpful. In general, catching an exception gives you a chance to fix the problem, or try again, or at least end the program gracefully.

In code that performs state changes or uses resources like files, there is typically cleanup work (such as closing files) that needs to be done when the code is finished. Exceptions potentially complicate this task, since they can cause a block of code to exit before reaching its normal end. The `finally` keyword provides a way to run some code when a given block of code exits, regardless of how it exits:
"""

# ╔═╡ 27691b1b-ae01-48e6-bfb9-75a3722b5d89
let
	fin = open(filename)
	try
		line = readline(fin)
		println(line)
	finally
		close(fin)

md"""The function `close` will always be executed.
"""

# ╔═╡ 22787ce0-8a7c-11eb-2c30-17f9710f7862
md"""## Databases

A *database* is a file that is organized for storing data. Many databases are organized like dictionaries, in the sense that they map from keys to values. The biggest difference between a database and a dictionary is that the database is on disk (or other permanent storage), so it persists after the program ends.

The `GDBM` package (`pkg"add https://github.com/BenLauwens/GDBM.jl.git"`) provides an interface to the *GDBM* (GNU dbm) library of functions for creating and updating database files. As an example, I’ll create a database that contains captions for image files.

Opening a database is similar to opening other files:
```
"""

# ╔═╡ 88d830ee-74ea-4bc4-8e9e-03d601629e17

	db = DBM(joinpath(tempdir(), "captions"), "c")
end

# ╔═╡ 40f96b32-2801-40d5-80a9-6db31c894de0
md"""The mode `"c"` means that the database should be created if it doesn’t already exist. The result is a database object that can be used (for most operations) like a dictionary.

When you create a new item, `GDBM` updates the database file:
"""

# ╔═╡ d70344f8-f080-45ac-b74a-301098c4894d

A limitation of `GDBM` is that the keys and the values have to be strings or byte arrays. If you try to use any other type, you get an error.

The functions `serialize` and `deserialize` can help. The `serialize` function can translate almost any type of object into a byte array (an `IOBuffer`) suitable for storage in a database:

"""

# ╔═╡ a8527f03-5baf-4245-b554-74682cd86383

!!! tip
    In fact, the storage of nonstrings in a database is so common that this functionality has been encapsulated in a package called `JLD`.

md"""## Command Objects

Most operating systems provide a command-line interface, also known as a shell. Shells usually provide commands to navigate the filesystem and launch applications. For example, in Unix you can change directories with cd, display the contents of a directory with ls, and launch a web browser by typing (for example) **`firefox`**.

Any program that you can launch from the shell can also be launched from Julia using a *command object*:

1. Write a program that searches a directory and all of its subdirectories, recursively, and returns an array of complete paths for all files with a given suffix (like *.mp3*).
2. To recognize duplicates, you can use `diff` (Unix, Linux, MacOS) or `fc` (Windows) to compare two files.
