In the next few sections, we’ll write two functions that add time values. They demonstrate two kinds of functions: pure functions and modifiers. They also demonstrate a development plan I’ll call *prototype and patch*, which is a way of tackling a complex problem by starting with a simple prototype and incrementally dealing with the complications.

Here is a simple prototype of `addtime`:
"""

# ╔═╡ d271b35e-387f-4a30-95b5-3e4dd70de08e
function addtime_proto(t1, t2)

# ╔═╡ bf45464c-e9ac-42b3-8e8b-ecb66b05940f
md"""The function creates a new `MyTime` object, initializes its fields, and returns a reference to the new object. This is called a *pure function* because it does not modify any of the objects passed to it as arguments and it has no effect, like displaying a value or getting user input, other than returning a value.

To test this function, I’ll create two `MyTime` objects: start contains the start time of a movie, like *Monty Python and the Holy Grail*, and duration contains the running time of the movie, which in this case is 1 hour 35 minutes.

`addtime` figures out when the movie will be done:
"""

# ╔═╡ 7f6073ff-e427-4d49-92c2-c9202c96d7f6

# ╔═╡ 1a8c7798-8ce1-11eb-1b70-03289e5e2180
md"""## Modifiers

Sometimes it is useful for a function to modify the objects it gets as parameters. In that case, the changes are visible to the caller. Functions that work this way are called *modifiers*.

`increment!`, which adds a given number of seconds to a mutable `MyTime` object, can be written naturally as a modifier. Here is a rough draft:
"""

# ╔═╡ 4e99b0c9-f103-448c-967d-a2e56306188d
function increment!(time, seconds)
	time.second += seconds
	if time.second >= 60
		time.second -= 60
		time.minute += 1
	end
	if time.minute >= 60
		time.minute -= 60
		time.hour += 1
	end
	return nothing
end

# ╔═╡ 14e5bd9c-37fb-40e6-b011-0ed4a85eb5f9
md"""The first line performs the basic operation; the remainder deals with the special cases we saw before.

Is this function correct? What happens if `seconds` is much greater than 60?

In that case, it is not enough to carry once; we have to keep doing it until `time.second` is less than 60. One solution is to replace the `if` statements with `while` statements. That would make the function correct, but not very efficient.
"""

# ╔═╡ 6b612e5e-8ce1-11eb-3f34-27e6a4589cd4

Write a correct version of `increment!` that doesn’t contain any loops.
"""

# ╔═╡ 82dc6d14-8ce1-11eb-3cdb-ab242222a29e
md"""Anything that can be done with modifiers can also be done with pure functions. In fact, some programming languages only allow pure functions. There is some evidence that programs that use pure functions are faster to develop and less error-prone than programs that use modifiers. But modifiers are convenient at times, and functional programs tend to be less efficient.

In general, I recommend that you write pure functions whenever it is reasonable and resort to modifiers only if there is a compelling advantage. This approach might be called a functional programming style.
"""

# ╔═╡ 8da363d8-8ce1-11eb-3953-011e42efaf71
md"""### Exercise 16-4

Write a “pure” version, `increment`, that creates and returns a new `MyTime` object rather than modifying the parameter.
"""

# ╔═╡ 9ca5d4a6-8ce1-11eb-22d2-093575ac8faa
md"""## Prototyping Versus Planning

Recall that the development plan I am demonstrating here is called “prototype and patch.” For each function, I wrote a prototype that performed the basic calculation and then tested it, patching errors along the way.

This approach can be effective, especially if you don’t yet have a deep understanding of the problem. But incremental corrections can generate code that is unnecessarily complicated, since it deals with many special cases, and unreliable, since it is hard to know if you have found all the errors.

An alternative is *designed development*, in which high-level insight into the problem can make the programming much easier. In this case, the insight is that a `Time` object is really a 3-digit number in base 60. The second attribute is the “ones column,” the minute attribute is the “sixties column,” and the hour attribute is the “thirty-six hundreds column.”

When we wrote `addtime` and `increment!`, we were effectively doing addition in base 60, which is why we had to carry from one column to the next.


This observation suggests another approach to the whole problem—we can convert `MyTime` objects to integers and take advantage of the fact that the computer knows how to do integer arithmetic.

Here is a function that converts `MyTime` objects to integers:
"""

# ╔═╡ 2d02dc2e-5363-470c-bb33-6c38d8810ad0
function timetoint(time)
	minutes = time.hour * 60 + time.minute
	seconds = minutes * 60 + time.second
	return seconds
end

# ╔═╡ 80045b83-3e76-438e-9785-cbe1418a903e
md"""And here is a function that converts an integer to a `MyTime` (recall that `divrem` divides the first argument by the second and returns the quotient and remainder as a tuple):
"""

# ╔═╡ 3095ad27-9f5e-4bd1-a00f-f3eede819925
function inttotime(seconds)
	minutes, second = divrem(seconds, 60)
	hour, minute = divrem(minutes, 60)
	return MyTime(hour, minute, second)

md"""You might have to think a bit, and run some tests, to convince yourself that these functions are correct. One way to test them is to check, for many values of `x`, that `timetoint(inttotime(x)) == x`. This is an example of a consistency check (see “Debugging”).

Once you are convinced they are correct, you can use them to rewrite `addtime`:
"""

"""

# ╔═╡ 7802d76a-8ce2-11eb-0a88-fbb7edbef1ab
md"""In some ways, converting from base 60 to base 10 and back is harder than just dealing with times. Base conversion is more abstract; our intuition for dealing with time values is better.

But if we have the insight to treat times as base 60 numbers and make the investment of writing the conversion functions (`timetoint` and `inttotime`), we get a program that is shorter, easier to read and debug, and more reliable.

It is also easier to add features later. For example, imagine subtracting two `MyTime` objects to find the duration between them. The naive approach would be to implement subtraction with borrowing. Using the conversion functions would be easier and more likely to be correct.

Ironically, sometimes making a problem harder (or more general) makes it easier (because there are fewer special cases and fewer opportunities for error).
"""

md"""## Debugging

A `MyTime` object is well-formed if the values of minute and second are between `0` and `60` (including `0` but not `60`) and if `hour` is positive. `hour` and `minute` should be integral values, but we might allow second to have a fraction part.

Requirements like these are called *invariants* because they should always be true. To put it a different way, if they are not true, something has gone wrong.

Writing code to check invariants can help detect errors and find their causes. For example, you might have a function like `isvalidtime` that takes a `MyTime` object and returns `false` if it violates an invariant:
