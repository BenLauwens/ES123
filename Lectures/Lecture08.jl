Strings are not like integers, floats, and booleans. A string is a *sequence*, which means it is an ordered collection of other values. In this chapter you’ll see how to access the characters that make up a string, and you’ll learn about some of the string helper functions provided by Julia.

md"""## Characters

English language speakers are familiar with characters such as the letters of the alphabet (A, B, C, ...), numerals, and common punctuation. These characters are standardized and mapped to integer values between 0 and 127 by the *ASCII standard* (American Standard Code for Information Interchange).

There are, of course, many other characters used in non-English languages, including variants of the ASCII characters with accents and other modifications, related scripts such as Cyrillic and Greek, and scripts completely unrelated to ASCII and English, including Arabic, Chinese, Hebrew, Hindi, Japanese, and Korean.

The *Unicode standard* tackles the complexities of what exactly a character is, and is generally accepted as the definitive standard addressing this problem. It provides a unique number for every character on a worldwide scale.

A `Char` value represents a single character and is surrounded by single quotes:
"""

A string is a sequence of characters. You can access the characters one at a time with the bracket operator (`[]`):

fruit = "banana"

md"""The second statement selects character number 1 from `fruit` and assigns it to `letter`.

The expression in brackets is called an *index*. The index indicates which character in the sequence you want (hence the name).

All indexing in Julia is 1-based—the first element of any integer-indexed object is found at index `1` or `begin` and the last element at index `end`:
"""

`length` is a built-in function that returns the number of characters in a string:

fruits = "🍌 🍎 🍐"

# ╔═╡ 91702abe-e80a-4ca4-bbe3-c09ab52a719e
md"""But you might not get what you expect.

Strings are encoded using *UTF-8 encoding*. UTF-8 is a variable-width encoding, meaning that not all characters are encoded in the same number of bytes.

The function `sizeof` gives the number of bytes in a string:
"""

# ╔═╡ c38b19a8-d762-4105-9a95-374cd60eb92c
sizeof("🍌")

# ╔═╡ 4140d298-d635-4065-a0f6-97341843830a
md"""Because an emoji is encoded in 4 bytes and string indexing is byte-based, the fifth element of fruits is a `SPACE`.

This also means that not every byte index into a UTF-8 string is necessarily a valid index for a character. If you index into a string at an invalid byte index, an error is thrown:
"""

"""

# ╔═╡ ac377fee-76e5-11eb-1736-9190b5c92214
md"""## Traversal

A lot of computations involve processing a string one character at a time. Often they start at the beginning, select each character in turn, do something to it, and continue until the end. This pattern of processing is called a *traversal*. One way to write a traversal is with a `while` loop:
"""

# ╔═╡ b2688d18-63a3-48ff-9177-a3c3c8df75d6
let
	index = firstindex(fruits)
	while index <= sizeof(fruits)

end

# ╔═╡ 6e2b5f63-0e71-4e83-9932-d741ecab7113
md"""This loop traverses the string and displays each letter on a line by itself. The loop condition is `index <= sizeof(fruit)`, so when `index` is larger than the number of bytes in the string, the condition is `false` and the body of the loop doesn’t run.

for letter in fruits
	println(letter)
end

# ╔═╡ d261b9bf-e0d2-43aa-9ed5-6bfde8acb586
md"""Each time through the loop, the next character in the string is assigned to the variable `letter`. The loop continues until no characters are left.

The following example shows how to use concatenation (string multiplication) and a for loop to generate an abecedarian series (i.e., in alphabetical order). In Robert McCloskey’s book *Make Way for Ducklings* (Puffin), the names of the ducklings are Jack, Kack, Lack, Mack, Nack, Ouack, Pack, and Quack. This loop outputs these names in order:
"""

A segment of a string is called a *slice*. Selecting a slice is similar to selecting a character:
"""

md"""!!! tip
    A semicolon in REPL mode not only allows you to put multiple statements on one line but also hides the output.

The operator `[n:m]` returns the part of the string from the `n`th byte to the `m`th byte, so the same caution is needed as for simple indexing.

The `begin` / `end` keyword can be used to indicate the first / last byte of the string:
"""

md"""## Strings Are Immutable

It is tempting to use the `[]` operator on the left side of an assignment, with the intention of changing a character in a string. For example:
"""

# ╔═╡ 3473ae36-6bd9-4691-9590-46456d41c1da
greeting = "Hello, world!"

# ╔═╡ 8e117208-3800-45cd-8482-3db7076867cc
greeting[1] = 'J'

# ╔═╡ 1721dd8c-9409-4b8d-a4a6-3f2649f5f7a8
md"""The reason for the error is that strings are *immutable*, which means you can’t change an existing string. The best you can do is create a new string that is a variation on the original:
"""

# ╔═╡ bfd166f1-0663-45a3-9e93-588a705cba4d
let greeting = greeting
	greeting = "J" * greeting[2:end]
end

# ╔═╡ dfa99f93-676e-453b-b64b-a22f5ee63170
md"""This example concatenates a new first letter onto a slice of `greeting`. It has no effect on the original string. The variable `greeting` declared directly after `let` is an independent copy and can be reassigned in the `let` block.

md"""## String Interpolation

Constructing strings using concatenation can become a bit cumbersome. To reduce the need for these verbose calls to string or repeated multiplications, Julia allows *string interpolation* using `$`:
"""

# ╔═╡ 42b568fb-18eb-425a-82b2-2a5fd978b72a

greet * ", " * whom * "!"

# ╔═╡ 3609fa56-ffb7-4d02-b9e3-bd96fe488549
md"""String interpolation can however have a performance penalty.

The shortest complete expression after the `$` is taken as the expression whose value is to be interpolated into the string. Thus, you can interpolate any expression into a string using parentheses:

This is the first example we have seen of a `return` statement inside a loop. If `word[index] == letter`, the function breaks out of the loop and returns immediately.

If the character doesn’t appear in the string, the program exits the loop normally and returns `-1`.

### Exercise 8-7

Read the [documentation of the string functions](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/strings/). You might want to experiment with some of them to make sure you understand how they work. `strip` and `replace` are particularly useful.


The documentation uses a syntax that might be confusing. For example, in `search(string::AbstractString, chars::Chars, [start::Integer])`, the brackets indicate optional arguments. So, `string` and `chars` are required, but `start` is optional.

A string slice can take a third index. The first specifies the start, the third the end, and the second the “step size”; that is, the number of spaces between successive characters. A step size of 2 means every other character; 3 means every third, etc. For example:

A Caesar cypher is a weak form of encryption that involves “rotating” each letter by a fixed number of places. To rotate a letter means to shift it through the alphabet, wrapping around to the beginning if necessary, so *`A`* rotated by 3 is *`D`* and *`Z`* rotated by 1 is *`A`*.

To rotate a word, rotate each letter by the same amount. For example, `"cheer"` rotated by 7 is `"jolly"` and `"melon"` rotated by –10 is `"cubed"`. In the movie *2001: A Space Odyssey*, the ship’s computer is called “HAL,” which is “IBM” rotated by –1.

Write a function called `rotateword` that takes a string and an integer as parameters, and returns a new string that contains the letters from the original string rotated by the given amount.

!!! tip
    You might want to use the built-in functions `Int`, which converts a character to a numeric code, and `Char`, which converts numeric codes to characters. Letters of the alphabet are encoded in alphabetical order, so, for example:
"""

# ╔═╡ 95331274-d041-481c-b08c-b4c7d1d740e3
Int('c') - Int('a')

# ╔═╡ 6a10d9c1-7acc-453b-8d31-afe192489789
md"""!!! continue
    because *c* is the third letter of the alphabet. But beware—the numeric codes for uppercase letters are different:
"""

# ╔═╡ d3a5d2ec-aef5-4c42-8071-aa4811e5b53d

# ╔═╡ 9ab96fef-91d9-4f9e-a52e-5f7e45205bf4
