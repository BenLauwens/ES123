This chapter presents a case study that demonstrates a process for designing functions that work together.

It introduces turtle graphics, a way to create programmatic drawings. Turtle graphics are not included in the standard library, so to use them you’ll have to add the `NativeSVG` package to your Julia setup.

The examples in this chapter are best executed in a graphical web-based notebook using the `Pluto` package, which combines code, formatted text, math, and multimedia in a single document.

md"""## Turtles

A *module* contains a collection of related functions. Julia provides some modules in its standard library. Additional functionality can be added from a growing collection of *packages*.

Packages can be installed in the REPL:

```jlcon
julia> using Pkg

julia> Pkg.add(url="https://github.com/BenLauwens/NativeSVG.jl.git")
```

This can take some time.

Before we can use the functions in a module, we have to import it with a using statement:

```julia
using NativeSVG
```

In the notebook of this chapter these instructions are executed during the startup and can be found in the first cell.

The NativeSVG module provides a function called `Turtle` that creates a turtle object, which we assign to a variable named `🐢` (**`\:turtle: TAB`**).

Once you create a turtle, you can call a function to move it around. For example, to move the turtle forward:

```julia
let
	🐢 = Turtle()
	forward(🐢, 100)
	Drawing(🐢, 720, 10)
end
```

The arguments of `forward` are the turtle and a distance in pixels, so the actual size of the line that’s drawn depends on your display.

!!! info
    Each turtle is holding a pen, which is either down or up; if the pen is down (the default), the turtle leaves a trail when it moves. The picture shows the trail left behind by the turtle. To move the turtle without drawing a line, first call the function `penup`. To start drawing again, call `pendown`.

Another function you can call with a turtle as an argument is `turn` for turning. The second argument for turn is an angle in degrees.

To draw a right angle:

A `for` statement is also called a *loop* because the flow of execution runs through the body and then loops back to the top. In this case, it runs the body four times.

This version is actually a little different from the previous square-drawing code because it makes another turn after drawing the last side of the square. The extra turn takes more time, but it simplifies the code if we do the same thing every time through the loop. This version also has the effect of leaving the turtle back in the starting position, facing in the starting direction.

The following is a series of exercises using turtles. They are meant to be fun, but they have a point, too. While you are working on them, think about what the point is.

!!! tip
    The following sections contain solutions to the exercises, so don’t look until you have finished (or at least tried them).

### Exercise 4-2

Write a function called `square` that takes a parameter named `t`, which is a turtle. It should use the turtle to draw a square.

Write a function call that passes `t` as an argument to `square`, and then call `Drawing`.

### Exercise 4-3

Add another parameter, named `len`, to `square`. Modify the body so the length of the sides is `len`, and then modify the function call to provide a second argument. Call `Drawing again`. Test with a range of values for `len`.

### Exercise 4-4

Make a copy of `square` and change the name to `polygon`. Add another parameter named `n` and modify the body so it draws an ``n``-sided regular polygon.

!!! tip
    The exterior angles of an ``n``-sided regular polygon are ``\frac{360}{n}`` degrees.

### Exercise 4-5

Write a function called `circle` that takes a turtle, `t`, and radius, `r`, as parameters and that draws an approximate circle by calling polygon with an appropriate length and number of sides. Test your function with a range of values of `r`.

!!! tip
    Figure out the circumference of the circle and make sure that `len * n == circumference`.

### Exercise 4-6

Make a more general version of circle called `arc` that takes an additional parameter `angle`, which determines what fraction of a circle to draw. `angle` is in units of degrees, so when `angle = 360`, `arc` should draw a complete circle.

The first exercise asks you to put your square-drawing code into a function definition and then call the function, passing the turtle as a parameter. Here is a solution:

md"""The innermost statements, `forward` and `turn`, are indented twice to show that they are inside the for loop, which is inside the function definition.

Inside the function, `t` refers to the same turtle `🐢`, so `turn(t, -90)` has the same effect as `turn(🐢, -90)`. In that case, why not call the parameter `🐢`? The idea is that `t` can be any turtle, not just `🐢` so you could create a second turtle and pass it as an argument to `square`:

md"""Wrapping a piece of code up in a function is called *encapsulation*. One of the benefits of encapsulation is that it attaches a name to the code, which serves as a kind of documentation. Another advantage is that if you reuse the code, it is more concise to call a function twice than to copy and paste the body!

The next step is to add a `len` parameter to `square`. Here is a solution:

The next step is to write `circle`, which takes a radius, `r`, as a parameter. Here is a simple solution that uses `polygon` to draw a 50-sided polygon:
"""

# ╔═╡ d18c5a05-ff08-4638-8dca-90a98e2595b4

# ╔═╡ ad812198-803c-45d9-82f4-ec182c0fc873
md"""The first line computes the circumference of a circle with radius ``r`` using the formula ``2πr``. `n` is the number of line segments in our approximation of a circle, so len is the length of each segment. Thus, polygon draws a 50-sided polygon that approximates a circle with radius ``r``.

One limitation of this solution is that `n` is a constant, which means that for very big circles, the line segments are too long, and for small circles, we waste time drawing very small segments. One solution would be to generalize the function by taking `n` as a parameter. This would give the user (whoever calls `circle`) more control, but the interface would be less clean.

The *interface* of a function is a summary of how it is used: What are the parameters? What does the function do? And what is the return value? An interface is “clean” if it allows the caller to do what he wants without dealing with unnecessary details.

In this example, `r` belongs in the interface because it specifies the circle to be drawn. `n` is less appropriate because it pertains to the details of how the circle should be rendered.

Rather than cluttering up the interface, it is better to choose an appropriate value of `n` depending on circumference:
"""

# ╔═╡ d3aadf12-e773-41b6-8667-5fce73eb2949
md"""Now the number of segments is an integer near `circumference/3`, so the length of each segment is approximately ``3``, which is small enough that the circles look good but big enough to be efficient, and acceptable for any size circle.

Adding `3` to `n` guarantees that the polygon has at least three sides.

We had to give this function in the notebook interface another name because a function with the same arguments can not be defined multiple times in different cells. In the REPL only the last definition is valid.

A *development plan* is a process for writing programs. The process we used in this case study is “encapsulation and generalization.” The steps of this process are:

1. Start by writing a small program with no function definitions.
2. Once you get the program working, identify a coherent piece of it, encapsulate the piece in a function, and give it a name.
3. Generalize the function by adding appropriate parameters.
4. Repeat steps 1–3 until you have a set of working functions. Copy and paste working code to avoid retyping (and redebugging).
5. Look for opportunities to improve the program by refactoring. For example, if you have similar code in several places, consider factoring it into an appropriately general function.

This process has some drawbacks—we will see alternatives later—but it can be useful if you don’t know ahead of time how to divide the program into functions. This approach lets you design as you go along.

md"""## Debugging

An interface is like a contract between a function and a caller. The caller agrees to provide certain parameters and the function agrees to do certain work.

For example, `polyline` requires four arguments: `t` has to be a turtle; `n` has to be an integer; `len` should be a positive number; and `angle` has to be a number, which is understood to be in degrees.

These requirements are called *preconditions* because they are supposed to be true before the function starts executing. Conversely, conditions at the end of the function are *postconditions*. Postconditions include the intended effect of the function (like drawing line segments) and any side effects (like moving the turtle or making other changes).

Preconditions are the responsibility of the caller. If the caller violates a (properly documented!) precondition and the function doesn’t work correctly, the bug is in the caller, not the function.

If the preconditions are satisfied and the postconditions are not, the bug is in the function. If your pre- and postconditions are clear, they can help with debugging.

As a result, the turtle ends up a few pixels away from the correct destination. The solution shown here illustrates a way to reduce the effect of this error. Read the code and see if it makes sense to you. If you draw a diagram, you might see how it works.

The letters of the alphabet can be constructed from a moderate number of basic elements, like vertical and horizontal lines and a few curves. Design an alphabet that can be drawn with a minimal number of basic elements and then write functions that draw the letters.

You should write one function for each letter, with names `draw_a`, `draw_b`, etc., and put your functions in a file named *letters.jl*.
