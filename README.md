# ES123: Computer Algorithms and Programming Project

Introductory programming course with an emphasis on learning to program in contrast to learning a programming language.

In the first part the students the students will discover the most important imperative programming techniques based on toy programming problems in [Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/doc/interpreter/), [Python](https://docs.python.org/3/), [Julia](https://docs.julialang.org/en/stable/) and [C++](http://www.cplusplus.com).

In the second part they will develop hands-on the skills to successfully finish a programming project:
- define/clarify the problem
- design the program
- code the program
- test the program
- document the program
